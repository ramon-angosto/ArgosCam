# Instruccions
In firs place print all the stl. files

- x6 spacers
- x2 Gopro clip
- All the other pieces, only one time
- **pcb components soldered, except LEDS and BUZZER, only the correspondent cables**

## Jeston Nano and pcb case
In first place, introduce the nuts (x6 M2), through the bottom holes of the base (stl name: Jetson_nano_base). Once this is done, the jetson nano and the pcb can be fixed to the base, using the appropiate screws x6 (M2 x 12). Remember to use an spacer (stl. file), between the base and the board, and also a washer between the boards and the screw.

In second place put the cover of the jetson nano case (stl name:jetson_nano_case_cover). Before fixing it down attach the camera cables. Use a wood screw to hold it in place.

## Screen case
In first place inrtoduce three M4 nuts in the appropiate hols in the interior part of the case (stl names: screen_case and screen_case1) . After this, lay the model flat on it's back, and using a plyers introduce x4 M2 nuts, on the four holes, located at the corners of the design, and also introduce four washers in the holes located over the nuts. Once this is done carefully introduce the screen and secure it using x4 (M2 x 20). Remeber to introduce the screen with the hdmi facing the inside. 

After the screen is fixed in place and the powerbank it's put inside the case the lid of the case (stl name: screen_case_side_cover), can be screwed down using 3 wood screws.

## Join Jetson nano case and pcb case
To join these two pieces, x3 (M4 x 10) have to be used. In the back side of the base (stl name: Jetson_nano_base), introduce three washers and using the m4 screws fix this piece to the screen case.

Then pass through the holes, at the top of the screen case, the cables for the LEDs and the buzzer, and solder the components.
